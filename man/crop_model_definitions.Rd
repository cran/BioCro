\title{Crop model definitions}

\description{
  In BioCro, a crop model is defined by sets of direct modules, differential
  modules, initial values, and parameters, along with an ordinary differential
  equation (ODE) solver. To run a model, these values, along with a set of
  weather data, are passed to the \code{\link{run_biocro}} function. For
  convenience, several crop model definitions are included in the BioCro R
  package. A full list can be obtained by typing \code{??crop_models} into the R
  terminal.
}

\details{
  Each crop model definition is stored as a list with the following named
  elements:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{direct_modules}: A list of direct module names; can be passed to
    \code{\link{run_biocro}} as its \code{direct_module_names} argument.

    \item \code{differential_modules}: A list of differential module names; can
    be passed to \code{\link{run_biocro}} as its
    \code{differential_module_names} argument.

    \item \code{ode_solver}: A list specifying details of a numerical ODE
    solver; can be passed to \code{\link{run_biocro}} as its \code{ode_solver}
    argument.

    \item \code{initial_values}: A list of named quantity values; can be passed
    to \code{\link{run_biocro}} as its \code{initial_values} argument.

    \item \code{parameters}: A list of named quantity values; can be passed to
    \code{\link{run_biocro}} as its \code{parameters} argument, and also can be
    passed to \code{\link{evaluate_module}} and
    \code{\link{module_response_curve}} when investigating the behavior of one
    of the crop's modules.
  }

  These model definitions are not sufficient for running a simulation because
  \code{\link{run_biocro}} also requires drivers; for these crop growth models,
  the drivers should be sets of weather data. The \code{\link{soybean}} model is
  intended to be used along with the specialized soybean weather data
  (see \code{\link{cmi_soybean_weather_data}}). The other crops should be used
  with the other weather data (see \code{\link{cmi_weather_data}}).

  Some quantities in the crop model definitions, such as the values of
  photosynthetic parameters, would remain the same in any location; others, such
  as the latitude or longitude, would need to change when simulating crop growth
  in different locations. Care must be taken to understand each input quantity
  before attempting to run simulations in other places or for other cultivars.

  Typically, the modules in a crop model definition are defined as lists with
  some named elements; the names facilitate on-the-fly module swapping via the
  \code{\link{within}} function. For example, to change the soybean canopy
  photosynthesis module to the \code{BioCro:ten_layer_rue_canopy} module, one
  could pass \code{within(soybean$direct_modules, {canopy_photosynthesis =
  "BioCro:ten_layer_rue_canopy"})} as the \code{direct_module_names} argument
  when calling \code{\link{run_biocro}} instead of
  \code{soybean$direct_modules}.

  Because each crop model definition is stored as a list with named elements,
  it is possible to use the \code{\link{with}} function to save some typing when
  calling \code{\link{run_biocro}} or related functions such as
  \code{\link{partial_run_biocro}} or
  \code{\link{validate_dynamical_system_inputs}}. For an example, compare
  \verb{Example 1} and \verb{Example 2} below. Besides shortening the code,
  using \code{with} also makes it easy to modify a command to simulate the
  growth of a different crop; if the two models can use the same drivers, this
  switch can be accomplished with one small change (\verb{Example 3}).
