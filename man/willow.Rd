\title{Willow model definition}

\description{
  Initial values, parameters, direct modules, differential modules, and
  a differential equation solver that can be used to run willow growth
  simulations in Champaign, Illinois and other locations.

  To represent willow growth in Champaign, IL, these values must be paired with
  the Champaign weather data (\code{\link{cmi_weather_data}}). The parameters
  already include the \code{clay_loam} values from the
  \code{\link{soil_parameters}} dataset, which is the appropriate soil type for
  Champaign.

  Some specifications, such as the values of photosynthetic parameters, would
  remain the same in any location; others, such as the latitude or longitude,
  would need to change when simulating crop growth in different locations. Care
  must be taken to understand each input quantity before attempting to run
  simulations in other places or for other cultivars.

  This model was originally described in Wang \emph{et al.} (2015)
  [\doi{10.1111/pce.12556}]. Since its original parameterization, the behavior
  of several of its core modules has changed as bugs have been identified and
  fixed, so this model likely needs to be reparameterized before it can be used
  for realistic simulations.
