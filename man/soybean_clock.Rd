\title{Soybean-BioCro circadian clock model definition}

\description{
  Initial values, parameters, direct modules, differential modules, and
  a differential equation solver that can be used to run soybean circadian clock
  simulations in Champaign, Illinois and other locations. Along with the soybean
  growth specifications (\code{\link{soybean}}), these values define the soybean
  growth model of Matthews \emph{et al.} (2022)
  [\doi{10.1093/insilicoplants/diab032}], which is commonly referred to as
  \emph{Soybean-BioCro}.

  To represent a soybean circadian clock in Champaign, Illinois, these values
  must be paired with the weather data from \code{\link{cmi_weather_data}}.

  This model is described in detail in Matthews \emph{et al.} (2022)
  [\doi{10.1093/insilicoplants/diab032}] and Lochocki & McGrath (2021)
  [\doi{10.1093/insilicoplants/diab016}].

  Here, we use initial phases for the dawn and dusk oscillators of \code{200.0}
  and \code{80.0} radians, respectively. These values are optimized for
  simulations beginning at midnight on January 1, and should require minimal
  time for transient signals to die down. These values were determined by
  running a simulation for one year starting on January 1, and recording the
  oscillator states at the end of December 31.
