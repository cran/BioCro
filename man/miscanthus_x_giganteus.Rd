\description{
  Initial values, parameters, direct modules, differential modules, and
  a differential equation solver that can be used to run
  \emph{Miscanthus x giganteus} growth simulations in Champaign, Illinois and
  other locations.

  To represent \emph{Miscanthus} growth in Champaign, IL, these values must be
  paired with the Champaign weather data (\code{\link{cmi_weather_data}}). The
  parameters already include the \code{clay_loam} values from the
  \code{\link{soil_parameters}} dataset, which is the appropriate soil type for
  Champaign.

  Some specifications, such as the values of photosynthetic parameters, would
  remain the same in any location; others, such as the latitude or longitude,
  would need to change when simulating crop growth in different locations. Care
  must be taken to understand each input quantity before attempting to run
  simulations in other places or for other cultivars.

  This model was originally described in Miguez \emph{et al.} (2009)
  [\doi{10.1111/j.1757-1707.2009.01019.x}] and Miguez \emph{et al.} (2012)
  [\doi{10.1111/j.1757-1707.2011.01150.x}]. Since its original parameterization,
  the behavior of several of its core modules has changed as bugs have been
  identified and fixed, so this model likely needs to be reparameterized before
  it can be used for realistic simulations.
